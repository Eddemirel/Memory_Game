CARDS:
B mode has 12 cards - 6 pairs(4x3), M mode has 20 cards 10 pairs (4x5) and D mode has 32 cards 16 pairs (4x8) (rows x columns)
We will have 16 pairs of unique card patterns for open faces
Each game selects the necessary number of pairs randomly, and then allocates cards to the game grid randomly.
Background is black and the closed faces are all white. Cards are laid on the background closed unless they are selected to be open.

TURN:
Opening 2 cards means 1 turn
Each turn starts with the the card pointer pointing to left-top card. 
The user should be able to change the card pointer location using up down left right arrows to select a card.
The card that the card pointer points turns red.
To be able to open 2 cards in a turn: User must select the first card by navigating with the arrows of the keyboard, changing the location of the card pointer and observing the red selection. When the desired card is pointed, the user must hit enter, this card stays red until the second card is selected. Then the user continues to move the card pointer with arrows again, and again the pointed card turns red (now we have one constant and one moving red card). User must select a different card then the first selected one, and hit enter. Then 2 selected cards will display their open faces.
If 2 cards are a pair, then play clap audio, and these cards will remain open for the rest of the game.
If they are not then both will turn their back sides again (i.e. white)
This concludes a turn.
